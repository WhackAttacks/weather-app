# JavaScript Weather App
## Description
This JavaScript application is a simple weather app that fetches current weather data based on user input of a city name. It utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description. The app dynamically updates the UI to display the fetched data including the city name, weather icon, description, temperature, humidity, and wind speed. Additionally, it dynamically changes the background image based on the searched city, creating a visually appealing experience.
